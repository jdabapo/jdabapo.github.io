  <p>Successful software projects require more than just technical expertise. Figuring out what the client wants, collaborating in a team, managing complexity, mitigating risks, staying on time and budget, and determining, under various constraints, when a product is "good enough" to be shipped are equally important topics that often have a significant human component. This course explores these issues broadly and covers the fundamentals of modern software engineering and analysis.</p>
  <p>This course focuses on software engineering and analysis. At a high level, the course is organized around five core topics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Measurement and Risk Overview</li>
    <li>Quality Assurance (especially testing)</li>
    <li>Software Defects</li>
    <li>Software Design</li>
    <li>Productivity at Scale (coding)</li>
  </ul>
