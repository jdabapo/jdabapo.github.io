- Use of EventBus and observer and subscription pattern to handle events, and promote DRY principles.
- I worked on this as a solo project, doing everything but the art and sounds. The most challenging part of this, was using the EventBus pattern in conjuction with all the different systems.
- I took art from craft pix for the [background](https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-city-backgrounds-pixel-art/)
- Music and sound I took from [here](https://youfulca.itch.io/legendary-jrpg-battle-music-pack)

Some of the other other things that I was able to work on, are the enemy pausing and custom levels and game elements which I was able to enjoy.
